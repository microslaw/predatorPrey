ai prototyping:


input changes:
ADD self.X AND self.Y TO INPUTS
change input to cnn
	the cnn may be a cut out square around the entity. This reduces amount of input data, removes the need to pass entity's position
change inputs to vectors
	will require changing outputs to vectors, small neural network may be unable tolearn mapping 2,3 -> [1,0, ... 0]
more inputs in general
use coding in one-layer network to pass chunks of a screen
	similiar to idea of cnn but more compact data with less precision. The previous option is preffered


output changes:
change output to 2 coordinates + speed:
	if vectors are inputed, should be easier to learn to go in some direction

general changes:
make model one layered to increase stability


optimizations:
test only on sheep
	will swap to full simulation later

batch training
figure out wtf is going on in there, how q values are connected

use dual models with freezing - more stable, hard to do
